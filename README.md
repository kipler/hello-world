# hello-world
my first repository

# Meant in order to store misc. projects and files related to the ongoing learning of Python, Java, and the MEAN stack.

# May also include some projects with html, css, js, etc. Hopefully I can figure out what I want to do later.
# Currently a small time dev that uses regular expression with Kapow Studio, an automation bot creation and maintenance tool.
